Custom resource type for lvm
============================

This example shows how lvm physical volumes, volume groups and logical volumes can be tested. Not part of standard serverspec.

An example page in the [wiki](https://github.com/aschmidt75/serverspecplayground/wiki/Setting-up-a-new-resource-type-(LVM)) shows how to set up a custom resource type such as the lvm type here.
